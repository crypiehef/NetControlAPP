# reCAPTCHA Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up Google reCAPTCHA v3 for the NetControlApp to minimize bot registrations.

## Overview

The NetControlApp now includes:
- **Admin Authorization**: New user accounts require admin approval before they can login
- **reCAPTCHA Protection**: Registration form includes reCAPTCHA verification to minimize bots

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get reCAPTCHA Keys from Google

1. Go to [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create)
2. Click "Create" to create a new site
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Label**: NetControlApp (or your preferred name)
   - **reCAPTCHA type**: Select "reCAPTCHA v3"
   - **Domains**: Add your domain(s)
     - For development: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`
     - For production: Your actual domain (e.g., `netcontrol.example.com`)
4. Accept the reCAPTCHA Terms of Service
5. Click "Submit"

### 2. Configure Backend

Add the reCAPTCHA secret key to your `.env` file:

```env
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

**Note**: The secret key is shown only once when you create the site. Copy it immediately.

### 3. Configure Frontend

Add the reCAPTCHA site key to your frontend `.env` file:

```env
VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
```

**Note**: The site key is public and can be exposed in client-side code.

### 4. Environment Variables

Update your `.env` files:

**Backend `.env`:**
```env
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=6Lc...your_secret_key_here
```

**Frontend `.env`:**
```env
VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=6Lc...your_site_key_here
```

### 5. Development Mode

In development mode, if reCAPTCHA keys are not set:
- Registration will still work (reCAPTCHA is bypassed)
- A warning will be logged to the console
- This allows testing without reCAPTCHA setup

**Important**: In production, always set both keys for security.

## How It Works

### Registration Flow

1. User fills out registration form
2. reCAPTCHA v3 script loads automatically
3. When user submits form:
   - reCAPTCHA executes invisibly (no checkbox for v3)
   - Token is generated and sent to backend
   - Backend verifies token with Google
   - User account is created with `isEnabled: false` (pending approval)
   - First user is automatically enabled and made admin

### Admin Approval Flow

1. New user registers ‚Üí Account created but disabled
2. Admin logs into admin panel
3. Admin sees pending users in user list
4. Admin clicks "‚úÖ Enable" button
5. User account is enabled
6. User can now login

### Login Flow

1. User attempts to login
2. System checks if account is enabled
3. If disabled: Error message shown "Your account is pending admin approval"
4. If enabled: Login proceeds normally

## Admin Features

### User Management

In the Admin panel, you can now:

- **View Account Status**: See which accounts are "Enabled" or "Pending"
- **Enable Accounts**: Click "‚úÖ Enable" to approve new user registrations
- **Disable Accounts**: Click "üîí Disable" to temporarily disable accounts
- **Filter Users**: Status badges make it easy to see pending accounts

### Status Badges

- **‚úì Enabled** (Green): User can login
- **‚è≥ Pending** (Yellow): User is waiting for admin approval

## Security Features

### Protection Against Bots

- reCAPTCHA v3 analyzes user behavior
- Scores users based on interaction patterns
- Blocks suspicious registrations automatically

### Admin Authorization

- All new registrations require admin approval
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Admins have full control over user access

### Additional Security

- First user is automatically enabled (setup user)
- Admins cannot disable their own account
- Password validation and hashing
- JWT token-based authentication

## Troubleshooting

### reCAPTCHA Not Working

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Verify `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` is set in backend `.env`
   - Verify `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` is set in frontend `.env`

2. **Check Domain Configuration**:
   - Ensure your domain is added to reCAPTCHA site configuration
   - For localhost: Use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`

3. **Check Console Errors**:
   - Open browser developer console
   - Look for reCAPTCHA-related errors

4. **Development Mode**:
   - If keys are not set, reCAPTCHA is bypassed in development
   - Set keys for production use

### Users Cannot Login

1. **Check Account Status**:
   - Admin should verify user account is enabled
   - Check "Status" column in admin panel

2. **Error Messages**:
   - "Your account is pending admin approval" ‚Üí Account needs to be enabled
   - "Invalid username or password" ‚Üí Credentials are incorrect

## Testing

### Test Registration

1. Register a new account
2. Check admin panel for pending user
3. Enable the account
4. Attempt to login with new account

### Test reCAPTCHA

1. Complete registration form
2. Submit form
3. Check browser console for reCAPTCHA logs
4. Verify token is sent to backend
5. Check backend logs for verification status

## Production Checklist

- [ ] reCAPTCHA site created in Google Console
- [ ] Production domain added to reCAPTCHA configuration
- [ ] `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` set in production backend `.env`
- [ ] `VITE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` set in production frontend `.env`
- [ ] Test registration on production domain
- [ ] Verify admin can enable accounts
- [ ] Test that disabled accounts cannot login
