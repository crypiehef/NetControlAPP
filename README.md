- QRZ.com account with XML API access (optional, for callsign lookup)

### Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crypiehef/NetControlAPP.git
cd NetControlAPP
```

2. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit `.env` and set your JWT secret:
```
JWT_SECRET=your_very_secure_jwt_secret_key_here
```
Get a secret JWT Token here: https://jwtsecrets.com/#generator

4. Start the application:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

5. Access the application:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost (port 80)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001 (port 5001 to avoid macOS AirPlay conflict)

6. **Create your first account** by visiting http://localhost and clicking "Register"
   - **First user automatically becomes admin!** ⭐
   - Subsequent users will be operators by default

### Development Setup

#### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cat > .env << EOF
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/netcontrol
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
EOF

# Start MongoDB (if not using Docker)
# Option 1: Using local MongoDB
mongod

# Option 2: Using Docker for MongoDB only
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name netcontrol-mongodb mongo:7

# Start the backend
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend Development

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Configuration

## Updating the Application

### Updating to Latest Version

If you already have the app installed and want to update to the latest version:

1. **Navigate to your app directory:**
```bash
cd NetControlAPP
```

2. **Stop the running containers:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```

3. **Fetch all updates from GitHub:**
```bash
git fetch --all --tags --prune
```

4. **Pull the latest changes:**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

5. **Rebuild and restart containers:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

6. **Verify the update:**
```bash
# Check current version
git describe --tags

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -5
```

### Updating to a Specific Version

To update to a specific version (e.g., v1.2):

```bash
# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Fetch all tags
git fetch --all --tags

# Checkout specific version
git checkout v1.2

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Common Update Issues

**Issue: "Already up to date" but features are missing**
- Solution: Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to rebuild containers

**Issue: Database errors after update**
- Your data is preserved in Docker volumes
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs backend`
- If needed, restart: `docker-compose restart`

**Issue: Port conflicts after update**
- The app uses port 5001 (not 5000) for backend
- Frontend uses port 80
- Run `lsof -i :80` and `lsof -i :5001` to check for conflicts

## Docker Commands

### Start all services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stop all services
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service

docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

### Rebuild containers (after code changes)
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Restart specific service
```bash
docker-compose restart backend
docker-compose restart frontend
```

### Remove all data (including database)

## Troubleshooting

### Port 5000 Already in Use (macOS AirPlay)

If you see `bind: address already in use` on port 5000:

**This app uses port 5001** to avoid conflicts with macOS AirPlay Receiver. 
- Frontend: http://localhost (port 80)
- Backend API: http://localhost:5001

If you still have conflicts:
1. Check what's using the port: `lsof -i :5001`
2. Disable AirPlay Receiver: System Settings → General → AirDrop & Handoff → Turn OFF AirPlay Receiver

### MongoDB Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if MongoDB is running
docker ps | grep mongodb

# Restart MongoDB
docker-compose restart mongodb

# Check MongoDB logs
docker-compose logs mongodb
```

### Backend Not Starting
```bash
# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Ensure .env file exists with correct values
# Restart backend
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Frontend Build Issues
```bash
# Rebuild frontend
docker-compose up -d --build frontend
```

### QRZ Lookup Not Working
1. Verify your QRZ credentials are in correct format (username:password or username)
2. Ensure you have an active QRZ XML subscription
3. Check backend logs for API errors: `docker-compose logs backend`
4. Test the credentials directly on QRZ.com

### Logo Upload Failing
- Ensure file is an image format: JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, or WebP
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Check backend logs if upload continues to fail

### Theme Not Persisting
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Log out and log back in
- Theme is stored in localStorage and synced with backend

## Security Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Before deploying to production:

1. Change the default JWT_SECRET in `.env` to a strong, random value
2. Use strong, unique passwords for user accounts
3. Consider using HTTPS with SSL/TLS certificates
4. Set up proper firewall rules
5. Regularly backup your MongoDB database
6. Keep all dependencies updated

### Security Features

✅ **Multer 2.0**: Upgraded to fix all known vulnerabilities
- Protection against DoS attacks from malformed requests
- Memory leak prevention from unclosed streams
- Enhanced error handling for file uploads
- File type validation and size limits (5MB max)

✅ **Authentication Security**:

- Bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Protected API endpoints

✅ **Input Validation**:
- File upload validation (type, size, name)
- Form input sanitization
- MongoDB injection prevention
- CORS configuration
